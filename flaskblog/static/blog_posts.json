        "author": "Albert Einstein",
        "content": "Einstein's groundbreaking theory of relativity forever changed our understanding of the universe. It introduced the famous equation E=mc², showing the equivalence of mass and energy. This theory has had profound implications for cosmology, explaining phenomena like time dilation and the bending of light around massive objects. Einstein's work laid the foundation for modern physics and our exploration of space.",
